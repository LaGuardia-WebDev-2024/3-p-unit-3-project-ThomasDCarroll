    <li>My stress levels were THROUGH THE ROOF.</li>
    <li>I played this in one 13 hour sitting, which I DO NOT reccomennd. My decisions by the end were becoming increasingly unintelegent, and I ended up killing some characters on accident...</li>
    <li>Super cool story and atmosphere! I really bonded with the characters, which made my playthrough feel like constant emotional whiplash.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>After hearing so many good things about Little Nightmares, and remembering it being really good, I was so excited to finally play it myself. Unfortunately, I dont know if it lived up to my expectations.</li>
    <li>Dont get me wrong, Little Nightmares was good, but its length, and specifically the lack of difficulty made it so the game didnt have that much of an impact on me.</li>
    <li>I will say, however, that the Geisha was an amazing final boss, and I really enjoyed the ending!</li>

    <li>Conrad was my dude, like, he was way too smart for the rest of the cast...</li>
    <li>Because of the way me and my brother played,it ended up being a lot shorter so there were definitely some plot points we missed...</li>

  <h3>Thanks for looking through my project! I spent a lot of this year playing through games that I watched YouTube playthroughs of when I was younger (Inside, Little Nightmares, etc...), and have had a lot of fun reminiscing! If you have any games you really like or think I should play any of the sequels to the games I have here, feel free to tell me :D.</h3>
